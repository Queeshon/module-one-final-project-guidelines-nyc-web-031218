### Description

NBA Fantasy Mock Draft is an application that drafts NBA players to users'
roster. Each roster is comprised of five players. Users are able to search for
players by the players' full names, positions, or the team they play for. Once a
player is drafted, other users will not be able to draft that player. If users
are unsatisfied with their current draft choices, they have the option to delete
their rosters and start over. Enjoy!
